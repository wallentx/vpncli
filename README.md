# vpncli
Command line OpenVPN wrapper written in bash that supports multiple profiles, MFA, and push auth.

Add `vpncli` to your `$PATH`. You will need to manually create the profile directories/files on your machine at `$HOME/.vpncli/profile/YOUR_PROFILE`. Included in this repo is an example `$PROFILE_PATH` and `$PROFILE` that you can use as a reference.
